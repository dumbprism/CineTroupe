
## Cinetroupe : A brief Introduction

Welcome to Cinetroupe,

Cinetroupe is your one stop destination to be a film critic of your own terms. share reviews of the films you have watched and review them so that it helps other people watch a movie. This was inspired by letterboxd and was solely made for learning purposes. 

The main agenda of creating cinetroupe was a project assigned to me by the odin project curriculum as part of my learning in backend path.

### Components Used

### Routes

Well, as part of my learning , I have made use of routers to route and parse multiple static HTML pages and thus routes were just a cleaner and efficient way to write your server code and makes it look more professional and gives a better grip on the topic as well 

### Controllers

there were usage of several controllers and application middleware functions that came into usage. A lot of the `server.js` file consists of the `app.use()` , `app.render()` , `app.set()` controllers that help to control and adhere the MVC architecture and make this application much more practical to use

### View

Coming to the user interface of this, i have made use of the famous `ejs` engine , which is in particular referred in the documentation and much widely used, though there were other options such as `pug` yet `ejs` needed less efforts to understand and code since it was just like writing a `jsx` code.

### Approach 

The approach was quite simple, I had to create a form that takes in certain inputs from the users such as their `username` , `film`, `rating` and `review` and thus create an array of objects that stores these values and displays it in an `ejs` file. the key was to play with the routes or in understandable terms `HTTP verbs` such as `GET` and `POST` to make things work and display the inputs in a separate page.

Well, this was all about the project and my approach towards it, I would definitely create more such projects and this was just for my learning purpose,  I strongly suggest to those who are willing to learn development, take up the TOP (the odin project) curriculum and you'll indeed learn a lot .
