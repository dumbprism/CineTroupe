            <p id="welcome-text">Cinetroupe, is a one stop destination for you to be a film critic and also view what others think about a film. 
                This was inspired by Letterboxd which is a very big and popular platform for film enthusiasts to log and write reviews about a film. Well, 
                since I am a film enthusiast myself, I came up with this idea of sharing a platform similar to Letterboxd where you can write reviews about films.
                 Be your own film critic.
